# Projects Section Update Instructions

I couldn't extract the exact app names from Google Play Store due to the HTML structure.

## What You Need to Do:

1. Visit each app link and get the REAL app name:
   - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raka.gen_z_word
   - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raka.water_reminder  
   - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.solo.relaxme

2. Visit Chrome Web Store links and get extension names:
   - https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ndddnhdmcpfejnapomeifcoipjaiadmc
   - https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hoonigmggicemlabcpfgnndlmllinpcj

3. For TikTok filters, I've added all 3 links you provided

4. Open index.html and search for each project card, then update:
   - The <h3> tag with the real app/extension name
   - The <p> tag with a better description
   - Add app icon URLs if you have them

## Current Status:
✅ 3 Mobile Apps added
✅ 2 Chrome Extensions added  
✅ 3 Snapchat Lenses added
✅ 3 TikTok Filters added (FIXED - was only 1 before)

All links are correct, just need real names!
